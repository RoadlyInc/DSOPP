# Summary

Direct simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is an active research topic in the computer vision community. One of the first working examples of direct SLAM is Direct Sparse Odometry(DSO) by Engel et al. Since the release of the DSO code, researchers have proposed several extensions to the original method. The original DSO code was not designed with a presumption of continuous development and, therefore, does not follow many good software principles. Consequently, follow-up works inherit the mistakes in the code as well as poor software practices. To facilitate the research in the field we propose our reimplementation of the DSO designed to be easily modifiable and extendable. Another contribution is extensive testing of the functionality and supporting mathematical hypotheses.
